# Quirky Clever Sass

My name is Erin. I am a computer scientist in training who loves to write. Sometimes I write code; sometimes my writing 
explores the English language. Quirky Clever Sass is a blog showcasing my English language writing. You can explore my other 
repositories for code. I tend to write thoughts that bud into my head because I realized people think I say funny things. Many 
times I don't say them. I can be quirky. I can be clever. All in all, I am a bit sassy.  This blog allows me to be silly on a 
web page. Please Enjoy.
